## Might fix the shitty stuttering and FPS lags POE1+2 related.
Had this problems ever since starting on POE1 and after lots of PC upgrades this never got better. Yet I don't have this problems on other games, running smooth on full FPS. I never had stable FPS in POE especially if theres happening a lot on the screen. Also when it rarely ran "smooth" there still was some feeling of micro stuttering I recognized.

The lowest performance I had on the standalone client, it was the absolute worst nightmare for me. Going to Steam made it better, but still far away from perfect.

So POE2 should have made it better? No. Turned down graphic settings to medium/low, still no smooth game. About to have 30 to max. 60 fps in general when playing.
Since POE2 is a fork of POE1 all those start parameters should work, beside they might have actively deacitvated them on POE2. But don't know that.

On Steam I am on these start commands now:

**-USEALLAVAILABLECORES --nologo --waitforpreload --noasync --softwareaudio**

I added parameteres one by one, then testing, then adding the next. What really made it for me was **--softwareaudio** (lol). Im still playing on lower settings, tried **Vulkan Engine** and feels bit better aswell.

Running it on my notebook too, making it very playable here.

(Posting my 2 Setups later on.)
